    You are to check if the given text has a complete structured workout plan in it, return "yes" if there is one, and "no" if there is not one. If the answer is "yes," also return the complete structured workout plan. Everything about the workout plan MUST be specified, otherwise there is no workout plan. 
    The workout plan must contain the number of sets and reps.
    If the workout plan refers to something else on the page (like a chart) make sure to refer to that for the data. Using the example below of a structured workout plan, extract the workout plan from the new message and generate one with the same structure.
