      "The disappointing Avengers Infinity War ended with Thanos finally getting all of the six Infinity Stones he so desperately sought and then using them to wipe out half of existence including beloved heroes like Black Panther Star-Lord and Spider-Man Avengers Endgame picks up a few weeks after The Snap as the remaining heroes try to pick up the pieces and figure out if theres a way to reverse Thanos destruction Immediately Endgame is a more focused piece than Infinity War by virtue of having a tighter smaller cast Thanks Thanos Its a more patient focused film even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies Whereas Infinity often felt bloated Endgame allows some of the more iconic characters in the history of the MCU a chance to be well heroic No longer mere pawns in a Thanos-driven plot Iron Man Captain America Black Widow Hulk and Thor break free of the crowd ably assisted by Hawkeye and Ant-Man In a sense this is the new Avengers and the tighter group of superheroes reminded me of the charm of Joss Whedons first Avengers movie one in which strong personalities were allowed to bounce off each other instead of just feeling like they were strapped into a rollercoaster headed in the same direction It also allows space for some of the best acting work in the franchise particularly from Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr who one realizes while watching this have turned Captain America and Iron Man into something larger than life for a generation\n"
