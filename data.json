    "Endgame is a film that feels like it was made by fans for fans - to the point where some scenes will undoubtedly be labeled as outright fanservice But its hard to view those moments as cynical pandering so much as earned and effective homages to the moments characters and relationships weve grown so invested in over the past 11 years Several scenes truly feel like a Jack Kirby splash page come to life and thats an utterly exhilarating realization something that forces you to absorb the sheer scope of what Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige and his team have assembled an interconnected cinematic endeavor beyond comparisonWhile Infinity War did its best to juggle an enormous roster of heroes spanning the entirety of the MCUs history to mixed results depending on who you ask its no spoiler to say Endgame rightly narrows its focus to the original six Avengers with an assist from their fellow survivors giving them each a well-deserved moment - or several - in the spotlight The cost of sidelining so many characters is high but it pays off brilliantly Markus and McFeelys script allows for some unexpected subversions of certain heroes - including a few choices that will surely be divisive - but fans of the MCUs holy trinity of Iron Man Captain America and Thor should find plenty of iconic moments to satisfy them Thats not to say that other characters arent equally pivotal but for fear of spoilers we wont dig into that here At the same time several heroes get less to do than you might expect but when considering the MCU as a whole - as well as its potential future - you can see why the writers decided to pursue this particular path out of the 14 million possible ways it couldve goneMuch has been made of the films epic three-hour and one-minute length but considering how dense it is and truly Endgame packs a lot into that supersized runtime on first watch the pacing feels tighter than Infinity Wars and it doesnt outstay its welcome the way Lord of the Rings Return of the King did The main criticism that can be leveled against Avengers Endgame or at least the only one we can discuss in broad terms without spoiling anything is one that has plagued most Marvel movies up to this point an overreliance on overproduced CGI battles which despite elaborate staging cant help but devolve into numbing pixel-on-pixel slugfests The film features several impressive setpieces that effectively ground the action with emotional stakes and they prove to be some of the high points of the narrative but when the focus widens to a larger canvas some of the urgency and clarity is lost Thankfully much of the story retains a laser focus and specific goals for our heroes to pursue which gives Endgame a momentum and gravity that propels it even in the quieter more character-driven momentsIts in those moments where Endgame excels - as epic as some of the fight sequences are were also given insight into our heroes mental states in a way weve rarely had time for in past team-ups there are pauses for grief guilt love and longing which ultimately makes the escalating action all the more rewarding But perhaps Endgames greatest accomplishment is how it deepens our understanding and appreciation of the movies that preceded it This is truly a climax to an entire franchise not just a resolution to the cliffhanger of Infinity War Even though we know the MCU will continue in one form or another thanks to the prequels sequels and spinoffs that are already in development theres no denying that this is the end of an era - not just for our heroes but for a generation of fans who have grown and changed and forged their own families alongside them Endgame may be the final film Stan Lee appears in but thanks to these indelible characters and the actors who breathed life into them it feels like his momentous artistic legacy is in good hands",
    "Supported by Avengers Endgame Review The Real Heroes Were the Friends We Made Along the Way - Avengers Endgame - Directed by Anthony Russo Joe Russo - Action Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi - PG-13 - 3h 1m No amount of money ever bought a second of time one character says to another  Im afraid I cant be any more specific than that  somewhere around the middle of Avengers Endgame So true so true and also in context so completely not true The intersecting axes of time and money are what this franchise is all about and while Im not an expert in studio math Id guess that a second of the movie based on what Disney and Marvel Studios paid to make it would buy a decent used car There are roughly 10860 of those  seconds not cars  nestled in between the quiet spooky opening and the last bit of end credits Which means that whatever a ticket costs in your neighborhood Avengers Endgame might count as a bargain At three hours and one minute its shorter than Titanic The Godfather Part II or Luchino Viscontis The Leopard And while the time doesnt exactly fly it doesnt drag either The two hours and forty minutes of Infinity War also directed by Joe and Anthony Russo felt infinitely longer Settling scores wrapping up loose ends and taking a victory lap  the main objects of the game this ostensibly last time around  generate some comic sparks as well as a few honest tears And why not Weve lived with these characters and the actors playing them for more than a decade and even when the party got hectic stupid or crowded there was no reason to complain about the guests For the most part its nice to see them again and a little sad to say goodbye Read the screenwriters explanations for plot points  What to read if you want more Avengers  How the movie did in Week 2 at the box office Chris Hemsworths Thor always kind of neurotic for a buff deity with a mighty hammer has let himself go turning into a fat Lebowski with mommy issues War Machine Don Cheadle Black Widow Scarlett Johansson and Hawkeye Jeremy Renner have more to do than previously I wish that were also true of Tessa Thompsons Valkyrie The Hulk Mark Ruffalo has made peace with his essential duality Robert Downey Jr looking handsomely grizzled exercises his seniority with a light touch Hes been around the longest  the first Iron Man was in 2008  and combines the duties of unofficial chief superhero with those of master of ceremonies Its not all fun and games A lot of heroes died at the end of Infinity War and their loss weighs heavily on the survivors perhaps especially on Nebula Karen Gillan whose father was responsible for the slaughter Thanoss deployment of the six Infinity Stones to wipe out half the life in the universe was unforgivable of course  I cant believe I just typed that  but it proves to have been helpful to the Russos the screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and the audience We and they have a manageable dozen or so major characters to keep track of which leaves room for some of the alternately lump-in-throat tongue-in-cheek ensemble work that has always been the seriess most potent weapon The Avengers cycle may require an escalating series of battles to save the universe from ultimate evil  each manifestation more ultimate than the last with Thanos Josh Brolin as the ultimate ultimate of them all  but the engine that keeps it running is friendship This isnt the same as harmony Going back to the earlier movies Hulk and Thor have had their moments of friction as have Iron Man and Captain America Chris Evans The personal and political bad blood between those two most acute in Captain America Civil War continues to simmer at least at first But the mood over all is tender and comradely touched by acute grief and the more subtle melancholy of what everyone seems to understand is the Last Big Adventure About that adventure I wont say much though it strikes me that the shape of the plot is less vulnerable to spoilage than the little winks and local surprises along the way Everything you need to know before Endgame in two minutes Those are the rewards for sitting through all those movies patiently waiting for the post-credit stingers collecting Easter eggs while your friends were texting or your dad was napping and generally doing the unpaid labor of fandom for all these years Was it worth it In the aggregate I have my doubts but the chuckles and awws youll hear around you in the theater at certain moments attest to the happy sense of participation that lies at the heart of the modern fan experience At its best  and Endgame is in some ways as good as it gets  the Avengers cosmos has been an expansive and inclusive place That has proved to be good business Disney and Marvels accomplishment will be duly inscribed in the annals of commerce to be studied for many years to come There has been variety  silly movies and somber ones chapters that proclaim their topicality and episodes that embrace pure escapism  as well as consistency Any single film can serve as a point of entry and insider status is easy enough to obtain There has never been anything difficult or challenging which is a limitation as well as a selling point None of the 22 films in this cycle are likely to be remembered as great works of cinema because none have really tried Its fun to see the actors in these roles we know are capable of better and also satisfying to appreciate the efforts of those who might not be Some first-rate directors have taken up the banner and burnished the brand Their past and future masterpieces will most likely be found elsewhere Still Endgame is a monument to adequacy a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time Not that its really over of course Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work The story which involves time travel allows for some greatest-hits nostalgic flourishes and the denouement is like the encore at the big concert when all the musicians come out and link arms and sing something like Will the Circle Be Unbroken You didnt think it would get to you but it does Avengers Endgame Rated PG-13 Swearing and fighting Running time 3 hours 1 minute",
    "\tAvengers Endgame, the 22nd movie to emerge from the Marvel Cinematic Universe birth canal and the capper to the two-part saga that began with last year's Avengers Infinity War, makes more sense as an event than as a movie. The film has been meticulously crafted for people who care deeply about these characters, and it's likely most of those viewers will leave the theater satisfied. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo—also the directors of Avengers Infinity War as well as two of the Captain America films—and their team of writers have ensured, with machinelike precision, that each Avenger gets his or her proper allotment of sensitive moments as well as heroic ones. Once in a while, Endgame is enjoyable on its own terms, though mostly you'll be better off if you have at least a rough working knowledge of the MCU movies that have preceded it. It's an entertainment designed to please many, many people and disappoint as few as possible, extravagant without necessarily having a vision beyond its desire not to put a foot wrong. It's bold in the safest possible way. In other words, as movies that are part of multi-billion-dollar franchises go, Avengers Endgame is good enough.\n\tI must note here that I have little invested in the Marvel movies as the result of any attachment to Marvel comics. But I do care about the work of the actors who appear in them—performers like Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson, Chadwick Boseman and Robert Downey Jr., Zoe Saldana and Jeremy Renner. All of these people have been terrific in MCU movies, even when they could easily get by with being less than terrific. Watching Endgame, I realized that I do care about Marvel characters because these actors have made me care. The skill those actors—along with some I haven't mentioned, like Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatch—bring to the Marvel movies in general and to Avengers Endgame specifically only makes me wish these movies were breezier and more inventive and less obsessed with the high-stakes, big-money, fan-pleasing game. But you can't have everything and Endgame at least gives these actors something to work with.\n\tMinor-to-moderate spoilers follow, so if you want to experience Endgame with the naïve blankness of a tadpole freshly launched into the pond, please stop reading here.\n\tEndgame opens with an unnerving, gracefully filmed prologue involving Renner’s Clint Barton (Hawkeye, when in his superhero guise). He’s enjoying an outdoor picnic with his family when it becomes clear that what we’re seeing is a moment connected to the tail end of Infinity War—the instant supervillain Thanos (Josh Brolin) snapped his fingers—after having captured the last of those six all-powerful nuggets known as the Infinity Stones—and destroyed exactly half the world's population leaving the other half to grieve and remember. It's more cruel, when you think about it, to destroy half the world than all of it. This megalomaniacal act was Thanos’s way of cleansing what he viewed as a corrupt universe. But Hawkeye—having retreated from Avengers duty to be a family man—wasn't around to witness Thanos's big finale—and as Endgame begins, he doesn't yet know that half his friends have turned to dust. And so in this moment, we know what's going to happen before Hawkeye does. He turns away from his family for just a millisecond, and in a blink they’re gone.\n\tNext, we see the other remaining Avengers pulling themselves together after the tragedy—or, in the case of Scott Lang/Antman (Paul Rudd), just waking up after a Quantum Realm-induced nap. Lang quickly gets up to speed on what he missed, and comes up with the germ of a plan: Might the Avengers go back in time to foil Thanos's plan of half-destruction? Lang introduces his idea to remaining Avengers Steve Rogers/Captain America (Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Johansson) and James Rhodes/War Machine (Cheadle). They bring this spark of an idea to the guy who might be able to make it work, Downey's Tony Stark/Iron Man, who barely survived Thanos’s destructathon. First, Stark says it’s impossible; then he changes his mind—but he also worries that if the scheme doesn’t work, he’ll lose all he’s gained in what has for him become a bittersweet time, an era during which he’s mourning his lost friends but also starting a new life for himself.\n\tThe plan to turn back time is less a major plot point than a mechanism to keep the story clicking, and the middle section—in which the Avengers break into groups to travel to specific places and years where they can grab one Infinity Stone or another before Thanos can get his dirty mitts on any of them—is the movie's finest. Avengers Endgame is a better movie than Avengers Infinity War in one important sense. It relies less on milking tears out of us for characters who have died, but who we know will come back again—they’re too valuable to the franchise to be gone for good—than on focusing on what each of these characters might mean to us, given our history with them.\n\tThe mid-section of Endgame shows the Avengers actors at their best. Chris Hemsworth, as a Thor who has slid into a state of pot-bellied depression post-Thanos, gets a chance to reunite with his long-dead mother, Frigga (Rene Russo), in the kingdom of his birth, Asgard. He greets her tentatively, almost shyly, nearly dumbfounded by the gift of seeing her again, even for a few moments: she discreetly asks about his funky eye. The tenderness between them is lush and quiet, underscoring what's most valuable about Endgame. There is only one gargantuan, booming fight scene, and it's not the centerpiece of the movie. It’s as if the Russo brothers have finally acknowledged that bigger, noisier battles amount to less rather than more. At least we can hope.\n\tEndgame does give us some arresting visuals—Thompson’s Valkyrie riding on a winged horse, anyone? But generally, the actors are Endgame's finest special effect. Though we're made to wait for the entrance of Boseman’s T’Challa/Black Panther, it’s worth it. He coasts into the movie on a regal cloud. And Robert Downey, after playing Tony Stark/Iron Man for perhaps too many years, snaps back into form. In the 2008 Iron Man, Downey brought a kind of frazzled elegance to the role of Stark—his nervous energy seemed to spark from his fingertips, as if it were too much for his body to contain. In the years since, his Iron Man performances have become more brittle, more reliant on tics. But in Endgame, Stark's moments of doubt feel lived-in—Downey’s performance is alive with prickly uncertainty. Even when Endgame hits its generally predictable beats, you can still count on the actors to shift the mood into slightly uncomfortable emotional territory. The Russos and their writers clearly took pains to give nearly each character a gratifying arc and a proper—if not necessarily soft—place to land. That must have been a lot of work, and a few of the Avengers get short shrift. The ever-so-powerful Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) drops out of the movie for a long stretch, eventually returning with—a short haircut. Some arc. But the Russos more than make up for that with the discreet, wistful coda they give Steve Rogers/Captain America. It’s the movie’s single most gorgeous element, perfectly fitting for a guy who entered a 70-year sleep right after finding the love of his life.\n\tEvans’ Captain America has always been, physically speaking, the beefiest of all the Avengers— as sturdy and wholesome as the after picture in a Charles Atlas ad. Yet Evans has also always been one of the most understated actors in the franchise. As Steve, Evans’ smile is easy, friendly, in a stock all-American way. But there’s never been any swagger behind it. It’s the smile of a guy who’s lost something valuable, whose view of the future is perpetually tinted with the color of what he left behind.\n\tAvengers Endgame isn't a great movie, but there are flashes of greatness in it, and quite a few of them belong to Evans. His Captain America rewards us with a revelation and escapes with a secret. The best thing in Avengers Endgame is everything he doesn't say.",

    "Avengers Endgame 2019 Movie Review Boo Zero Stars Just kidding I thought that Id give some fellow nerds a brief heart attack Good start I like to think so In All Seriousness What are you reading this for Why arent you out at the theater watching Avengers Endgame for the tenth time The rest of the world seems to be doing that right now whats wrong with you Or did the theater owner kick you out to help ease yourself out of this addiction youre struggling with Damn Marvel junkie Alright Im Done Being An Ass Now this time in all seriousness this may be the absolute most pointless review I will ever write in my life Quite literally everyone has probably already seen Endgame multiple times over and it hasnt even been out a full week yet I debated internally on whether or not to bother writing a review at all its a very solid flick that is already getting more than enough attention Then I thought about it a little more realizing that maybe I do have a take on critiquing this movie that no one else really can write That being my own personal journey getting to where we are now in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as of 2019 2008 In 2008 I had little to no clue as to who the hell Iron Man/Tony Stark was A rich guy that fought crime in a costume I already had Batman how was Iron Man going to make much of an impression on me Through the power of Robert Downey Jr thats how When the first Iron Man film came out I was 16 years old and was pretty skeptical going into it then coming out of it my family and I basically found the movie that wed watch together on a weekly basis for a very long time We had a genuine blast watching Jon Favreaus Iron Man again and again when it made it to home video Any time it popped up on TV there was no need to continue channel surfing Any time we were bored and didnt have much else going on we threw that sucker right into the DVD player Hell wed go to sleep watching that movie almost on a nightly basis simply because it was that enjoyable of a movie for us We loved it and couldnt get enough of it At this point Im honestly not entirely sure if that DVD works anymore We must have worn that thing out at this point Downey is incredible in the charismatically sarcastic role of Tony Stark a role that was practically made for him The action was exciting and looked spectacular we hadnt seen special effects put on such a enormous scale in quite some time and it was unbelievable for us to witness The cherry on top was always the RoboCop reference I loved that I love that movie and to this day it still holds a soft spot in my heart However as spectacular Iron Man was I had no idea it would escalate to become something even bigger 2010  2019 Ive seen this cinematic universe grow from a single fun superhero movie to a total juggernaut amongst the globe Its rather astonishing thinking back to when I thought that there was no way Marvel was ever going to get this shared universe pieced together Theres no way that we will ever see these dominating hero personalities work off each other in a single movie Theres no way to make a guy running around in a star spangled banner costume not laughable Theres no way that theyll be able to make a movie with a talking raccoon and a tree man actually good Theres no way Ant-Man could ever hit it off with general audiences Theres no way this big purple dude is going to live up to all this build-up and hype around him after several movies of teasing Theres no way theres ever going to be a Black Widow movie okay that last one presently still holds up to be true Pretty much every time I have uttered the claim theres no way Marvel has found a way to shove it back in my face Color me wildly impressed especially with their movie track record holding far more hits than misses as well Sure there have been a few films in the Marvel line-up that I havent much cared for In all honesty there hasnt been a single MCU flick that Id ever consider being a truly bad film though There are the occasional letdowns but the worst quality that an MCU movie has ever reached for me was simply just okay Not terrible just okay with usually enough entertainment value to always carry me through somehow The rest of the world may disagree with me on that but Im rather convinced that a lot of those people have never seen an real bad film such as Nukie The Trump Prophecy or any Dinesh DSouza documentary either Endgame So here it is eleven years in the making has all led up to this in my opinion it did not disappoint In case you are wondering there will probably not be any spoilers in this review At least Im not planning to spoil anything at this time if that changes though I promise to put up a warning prior to said spoiler Avengers Endgame may possibly be the most epic superhero movie that I have personally ever experienced The action sequences in this particularly the final battle is the definition of epic Its big its bold and it is a full three hour rollercoaster ride of fun In terms of the story sadly since the actual plot of this movie seems to have been hidden in all",
    "I dont care about superheroes I dont care about either Marvel or DC respectively All I care about are good movies Infinity War was a decent movie It wasnt outstanding but it was bold and daring even though it had flaws more minor than major ones but nonetheless So I wasnt hyped about Endgame I havent even watched all the other Marvel movies leading up to it But today I bought a ticket sat down in an early screening with the cinema all to myself and saw what has to be one of the best movies of the last decade Avengers Endgame is popcorn-cinema at its very best It doesnt have the best storytelling or the best dialogue or the most-layered characters but it is the true definition of a blockbuster This is a movie that despite its runtime always entertains Yes there are parts that feel a little drawn out or that feel stretched but in the end I applaud Marvel for giving everything the time it needed to develop There is nothing rushed there is nothing left unanswered there are no plotholes that get brushed over for pure spectacle You understand everything and all the struggle on the silver screen plunges directly into your heart All the build-up makes the finale of this movie so more worth it It makes you laugh but doesnt lose its dramatic tone it makes you cheer but youre never unafraid it makes you cry but youre never out of hope This is the best movie Marvel could have made I give this a 10/10 I am already contemplating whether I should see it again Special thanks to Stan Lee Jack Kirby",
    "Even at three-plus hours the gargantuan Avengers Endgame is light on its feet and more freely inventive than it needed to be Given the year-long wait its audience Pavlovian dogs myself woof included would have salivated over less Its better than Avengers Infinity War which was better than Avengers Age of Ultron and it is for a change conclusive My 16-year-old daughter regretted having put on mascara prior to the screening because by the end it was all over her face Even in Franchise-Tent-Pole-Universe land some superheroism is finite A spoiler-free review of such a secrecy-shrouded blockbuster would consist of a star rating or shudder a grade as well as a cautious dramatis personae though even here there might be trouble given that Marvel doesnt want you to know every character wholl pop up and in what context Recounting the very premise is problematic beyond the heroes obvious determination to reverse-disintegrate re-integrate the 50 percent of the galaxy wiped out in Avengers Infinity War by the Malthusian colossus Thanos What form will their improbable quest take and which characters will lead the charge At this early stage I must resist the temptation even to hint at momentous events Although it was nearly 50 years ago I remember the childhood friend who emerged from The Poseidon Adventure and yelled to everyone in the long line Shelley Winters dies Nowadays hed need to go into Witness Protection Inevitably Ill tell you things you dont know but promise not to tell you that Shelley Winters dies The beginning of Avengers Endgame reminds you that Marvel is run by very clever people or at least people who know enough to hire very clever people Tonally they change course frequently Avengers Infinity War ended with a noisy and tumultuous super-battle so Avengers Endgame begins with something quiet and down to earth You could almost be watching a real movie Clint Barton/Hawkeye Jeremy Renner is teaching his daughter how to line up and shoot an arrow Tending the grill his wife asks if they want mustard or mayonnaise on their hot dogs and father and daughter bond over the ridiculousness of mayonnaise on a hot dog Their little son calls for ketchup And then poof Barton is alone The music comes in so softly that you barely hear it over the flickering Marvel panels Tony Stark/Ironman Robert Downey Jr is discovered floating in a ship in space his oxygen dwindling his only company that reformed blue meanie Nebula Karen Gillan Downey looks gaunt ravaged his face finally denuded of all baby fat I would fear for the actors nutrition but the credits include the name of his private chef as well as Chris Hemsworths I dont mean to mock them though I applaud their co-stars for making do with craft services but Im constantly amazed by how detailed closing credits have become A close-up of Downey lasts a while the directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo stopping time the way the makers of the last Game of Thrones installment did mercifully forestalling the horrors to come Earth a la Thanos is full of fascinating contradictions that the Russos dont fully explore For example Tony Stark no longer lives in a high-tech fortress He lives in the woods He grows things His now-wife Pepper Gwyneth Paltrow reads magazines about composting perhaps the latest iteration of Goop featuring designer worms Were told that fewer people means fewer ships means cleaner water Far far away Thanos Josh Brolin plus CGI has a little farm himself A Malthusian who believed the galaxy would be better off with a fraction of the inhabitants he is apparently a Luddite too The surviving Avengers the core group of Ironman Hawk Thor Hemsworth Natasha/Black Widow Scarlett Johannsen Steve Rogers/Captain America Chris Evans Bruce Banner/Hulk Mark Ruffalo James Rhodes/War Machine Don Cheadle plus Rocket the space raccoon the wiseass voice of Bradley Cooper Nebula and recent arrival Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel Brie Larson are discovered some time later in mourning Serious mourning No self-respecting superhero could live with that level of failure The rift between Iron and Cap has gotten uglier Beginning with Captain America Civil War one of them came down on the side of civil liberties and the other on the side of security at all costs though I keep getting mixed up which is which Oh now I remember Cap is for civil liberties and Iron for security at all costs though this still strikes as off given that Stark is a free-market inventor and Rogers a consummate soldier Downeys Stark is fed up tired eager to leave the field and start a family It falls to the Widow in her mopey desultory way to keep the Avengers going I will always be Johannsens number one fan but I do miss the witty and agile Widow of the first Avengers movie Thor and Hulk are different from what you remember Is this a spoiler I cant tell anymore Thor is fat hairy and alcoholic the Internet taking its cue from a Stark wisecrack has already dubbed him Lebowski Thor This is welcome given that the Avengers have a ramrod hero in Captain America and Hemsworth is livelier when hes self-parodic as in the game-changing Thor Ragnarok The new Hulk strikes me as more problematic Ruffalo is charming and funny and the damnedest sight but the Hulk was born like the archetypal werewolf Mr Hyde from the idea that humans dual natures cannot be reconciled A medium-sized rational Hulk is what all of us strive to be really as we learn to adopt more mature defense mechanisms But without an internal struggle Banner ceases to function as a dramatic character let alone a dangerous one The happiest surprise thats a spoiler phrase right there is that writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have shaped Avengers Endgame as a time-travel heist picture The nature of the quantum realm is more sophisticated than in say Back to the Future which gets a razzing Stark preferring the theories of Planck and contemporary egghead David Deutsch but the film echoes Robert Zemeckiss farce in how characters encounter their former selves from previous films They beat themselves up emotionally and literally Not to endorse Thanoss homicidal ideology but fewer people in the movie means richer more fertile scenes Evans bears his emotional weight with eloquence Coopers rat-tat-tat delivery is gangbusters Paul Rudds Scott Lang/Ant-Man has the kind of crack timing that doesnt just get laughs but moves the plot along lickety-split and even Paltrow rises to the occasion transcending her goopy baggage Gillan is outright marvelous her near-monotonic rasp carrying just enough half-tones to make you feel Nebulas inner struggle her patchwork Borg-like physiognomy the closest thing in the film to Greek mythology This Nebula is the dramatic equal of her father Thanos rendered brilliant by an army of artists and sound designers But its Brolin who gives him the voice and soul of a philosopher gone rancid He embodies the Dark Side better than many of his Star Wars counterparts For all the hoopla of her entry Larsens Captain Marvel brings little to the party perhaps to be fair because its really not her party I missed Benedict Cumberbatchs high style but not Chris Pratts stumblebum antics what there is of Pratt is enough Two supporting actors return with their faces de-aged by computers It works out okay for one of them but the other is the stuff of nightmares His head looks melted out of shape like a Star Trek teleportation accident There is as youd expect a colossal battle sequence but I wouldnt dream of telling you who pops up and when except to say that the Women of Marvel get a mighty crowd-pleasing shot Ill also say that this is the sort of war film in which the good die well and not at the hands of enemies Leonard Nimoys Mr Spock would nod with approval and even find his human side stirred In the days to come the components of Avengers Endgame will be analyzed and its Easter eggs enumerated Its actors will give interviews meant to seem giddily spontaneous but to one degree or another shaped by highly-paid publicists at the behest of corporate masters Although it will need to make room in the collective psyche for Sundays Battle of the Dead on Game of Thrones Avengers Endgame and the blockbuster HBO show will together reinforce the idea that mass hypnosis is possible even in our supposedly fractious and polyphonic pop culture I regret this on many levels but am not so hypocritical as to tell you Ive risen above it I had a good time and my daughter had a great one That said this kind of success is always a mixed blessing How soon before Disney stockholders will ask Whens the next HUGE one I hope not for a long while SPOILER ADDENDUM DO NOT READ BEFORE SEEING THE FILM My daughter wondered about the effect of 50 percent of humanity returning five years after theyve disintegrated as opposed to well not disintegrating in the first place What about the people who did indeed move on with their lives They have new relationships kids houses maybe Its bound to be an emotional shitstorm that dwarfs anything Thanos could come up with A TV series maybe",
    "Although I did not enjoy Endgame as much as I enjoyed previous Avenger movies this movie was worth the hype Every moment was unexpected and every gasp was rightfully elicited My initial expectations for the film were that somehow the characters that died in Infinity War would come back alive The movie is picked up right where it left off in Avengers Infinity War which solidified the fact that the ending of Infinity War was very real and the Avengers lost for the first time I went to watch the movie with my sister who has only watched a handful of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films not including Infinity War Surprisingly she didnt seem confused as the movie progressed as the only fact that seemed essential for her to know from Infinity War was that Thanos succeeded in wiping out half the life in the universe We are reacquainted with Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who becomes a key character in the film as his family vanished with the Snap This was also the first time I watched Captain Marvels role played by Brie Larson without seeing the characters own movie that came out about a month ago In my opinion it was not necessary to watch to understand her role which can be said for a lot of the film Ant-Man/Scott Lang played by Paul Rudd made a significant impact on the plot of this film because if it werent for him the Avengers would never begin their mission to fix what has been damaged To further fix the reality they live in the Avengers come together to use non-heroic powers specifically time travelling which Lang experienced to try to salvage what they can There were many times during the movie when the characters Hulk Scott Black Widow Hawkeye Iron Man Captain America Iron Patriot Nebula Rocket and Thor are time travelling where I was thinking so this is just the end what more could the characters have to fight for But I was proven wrong every single time Seeing all the characters unite in such an elegant fashion truly made my jaw drop After time travelling the Avengers are back in present time where they fight Thanos again This began my favorite scene when Captain America saves Thor from being killed by Thanos by using Thors hammer which Thor retrieved when he time travelled a huge moment I never expected as it was thought that Thor was the only one that could use the hammer Im pretty sure I was the only one who cheered and clapped during this moment Each entrance made by each character left a huge impact on the audience Eventually we see the return of the dead characters from Infinity War This entrance of all the revived characters happens at one time which left me a bit overwhelmed From one corner Black Panther and Shuri emerged from another Dr Strange appeared from another Spider-Man appeared and many more Avengers began to assemble to finally defeat Thanos Coming into this movie I of course braced myself as it has been known that many of the actors would not return after this movie It is hard to believe that the heroes I grew up with and make me go awe can somehow end their stories in such a short yet significant moment Nevertheless the Snap from Infinity War brought much heartbreak to the characters in the film but also new life lessons such as valuing family or friendship bonds and that having superpowers can only help you so much The real super power lies in the sacrifice for the benefit of all this movie was really centered on the notion that just because you are a hero does not mean you can fight enemies on your own The two sacrifices of Black Widow and Iron Man proved that they were willing to do anything to keep their planet safe The moment Tony Starks Arc Reactor the metal piece in his chest turns off signaling his death I became emotional We see his sacrifice and how much it affects his wife Pepper Potts and daughter who finds comfort in Happy now Further towards the end we see Thor give the Asgardian kingdom to Valkyrie and Captain America time travels one last time and comes back to the present to hand his shield to Falcon making him the new Captain America We also see Hawkeye reunite with his family members who are revived We dont see what happens to Hulk but we are to assume that the original six Avengers have officially parted ways Because the MCU films in the past had a scene after credits I patiently watched but ended up disappointed in that regard Nonetheless the title soundtrack played for the last time giving me goosebumps especially when each of the six Avengers had their own credit slide where a picture collage was shown for each actor a sort of goodbye from the franchise Walking out of the theater I was strangely satisfied I did not feel like I needed more answers like I felt after Infinity War Rather I felt like the movie accomplished everything that it was supposed to Its hard to believe that this chapter has come to a close these films have surrounded my childhood and coming of age so saying goodbye to these characters was not something I imagined until I watched the movie and realized this is the last time Ill see all these characters on screen For a moment I wished the movie would go on and continue going over three hours so I could just have some more time to soak it all in",
    "Avengers Endgame By Sandie Angulo Chen Common Sense Media Reviewer Common Sense Media Reviewers Intense but satisfying finale is an epic gift to MCU fans. A Lot or a Little: What you will and wontfind in this movie - Drinking, Drugs, & Smoking: Thor drinks a lot as a form of self-medication. Until a life-changing conversation, hes often looking for beer, ale, liquor, and/or wine, and bottles and barrels are shown. Did you know you can flag iffy content? Adjust limits for Drinking, Drugs, & Smoking in your kid's entertainment guide. Get started - Parents Need to Know: Parents need to know that Avengers Endgame is the final film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's current generation of movies, bringing together storylines and characters from 21 previous movies starting with 2008 Iron Man Families with younger kids should know that there's definitely as much intense violence decapitation explosions stabbings impalement crushing shooting etc and even more pain trauma and grief here than there was in Avengers Infinity War. Spoiler alert: A couple of beloved characters die, which will prove particularly upsetting. The language is similar to that in previous movies, mostly uses of s..t, ass, d...k - even Captain America swears this time. but there's no romance beyond a few brief embraces and kisses between established couples, a very minor male character talks about dating another man. Thor drinks a lot to numb his pain. Those who haven't seen any of the previous MCU installments should at least watch Infinity War and Captain America Civil War to follow the plot, but those who are familiar with the movies and comics will be rewarded with plenty of inside jokes and references. With themes of courage, teamwork, and perseverance, this epic Avengers finale is the ultimate gift to Marvel fans -- they'll laugh, cry and cheer as their favorite superheroes team up to save the universe one more time. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Positive Messages: Violence is the main means of conflict resolution but the story is primarily about courage, self-sacrifice, heroism, collective good. Themes include teamwork, perseverance, courage Central characters are willing to die and kill to save the universe and rescue Earth from the grief/trauma they've experienced. Also shows how important family and friendship are, how the concept of family is more than pure biology. People can have incredibly strong chosen families with friends who love you unconditionally. Emphasizes the idea of being who you are, not who you think you're supposed to be. Positive Role Models: Avengers and friends are flawed but unforgettably brave. They aren't individually as strong as Thanos but together they can accomplish the impossible. They make sacrifices, protect one another, and work together to save their loved ones and strangers alike. Women of Marvel once again have an opportunity, albeit a fairly brief one, to band together and family men like Scott/Ant-Man and Clint/Hawkeye are particularly invested in doing what's necessary to save loved ones. Captain America and Thor prove themselves worthy of their special weapons/powers. Characters make difficult life-or-death decisions that put them in danger for the greater good. Thanos believes he's bringing salvation to the universe but his method -- genocide -- is untenable. Violence & Scariness: Frequent and intense comic book-style action violence. Characters are killed, severely injured. Viewers will see dismemberment, decapitation, stabbing, crushing, shooting, impalement, choking, extremely destructive explosions, self-sacrifice, pursuit by scary monsters, etc. A character carries out ruthless vigilante justice, leaving lots of bodies in his wake. Weapons include guns, swords, axes, hammers, and missiles. Violence isn’t especially gory but a couple of injuries/deaths are a bit bloody. Frequent peril and danger Mourning/sadness Arguments & yelling/shouting. Spoiler alert: A couple of beloved characters die in order to save the universe and a couple of previously dead characters don't return to life, which could upset viewers.

What's the Story: AVENGERS ENDGAME is set after Thanos catastrophic use of the Infinity Stones randomly wiped out half of Earth’s population in Avengers Infinity War. Those left behind are desperate to do something—anything—to bring back their lost loved ones. But after an initial attempt—with extra help from Captain Marvel (Brie Larson)—creates more problems than solutions, the grieving, purposeless Avengers think all hope is lost. They’re reenergized by the eventual reappearance of Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), who was stuck in the quantum realm during the fight on Wakanda. He believes there could be a way to reverse Thanos' deadly snap. It takes a while to gather the squad—some of whom have changed dramatically—but eventually Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Ant-Man team up for one last, life-or-death mission to outsmart Thanos (Josh Brolin) and save the universe. Is It Any Good: The Russo brothers' poignant, powerful finale more than lives up to the hype. It’s a thrilling conclusion and a deeply emotional exploration of loss and love, duty and honor, friendship and family. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story focuses on the remaining Avengers and their post-trauma lives. Each seems overwhelmed by their failure, so when they start to regroup it’s clear that they’re far from the same confident, optimistic superheroes who thought they could defeat Thanos in Infinity War. The dads in the group are particularly effective at showing how personal the grief is, providing a contrast to the general sense of failure and loss that the single superheroes feel. As the often underappreciated Hawkeye, Renner stands out in a crowded field of immense talent for making his character feel central. His intensity and his platonic brotherly love for Natasha/Black Widow is perfectly conveyed Johansson does a lot of the emotionally resonant work in the movie, keeping tabs on everyone, encouraging her friends, and acting like everyone’s favorite sister – except in the Hulk’s case. The big three -- Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor—are also fabulous. Their differences have never been more obvious, but each proves that despite past conflicts and heartbreaks, they’re worthy and ready to fight side by side. There’s so much packed into the three hours of Avengers Endgame that it might seem overwhelming at times. This is clearly a film that will inspire repeat viewing. There are unexpected twists and moments of hilarity as well as more serious scenes and themes. Those well-versed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will delight in the many Easter eggs and clear fan service (yes, there’s still a Stan Lee cameo), while more casual fans will still find plenty of reasons to applaud. What’s also true is that the three-hour movie brings all the feels. Just when one gut-punching beat finishes, there’s barely enough of a break for a zinger from Tony or Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) before another oh no moment squeezes your heart. But don’t despair. This is a bittersweet example that the best heroes won’t allow hubris or insecurity to defeat them. Endgame ranks up there with The Return of the King and Deathly Hallows Part 2 -- all are epic, emotional, and exceptional franchise finales. Talk to Your Kids About: Families can talk about the action violence in Avengers Endgame. Does any of it seem realistic? Is it intended to? Is there a difference in the impact between hand-to-hand combat and catastrophic, buildings-collapsing-type explosions? How can a single death be just as, or even more, upsetting than the death of crowds? What are the movie’s messages about teamwork, courage, and perseverance? Why are these important character strengths? This movie deals with grief, loss, and trauma. How do the characters handle their pain differently? Which ones deal with trauma in a healthy way, and which don’t? What motivates them all to be better, as Natasha says? Why is it important for superheroes to be diverse? Do you think the Marvel Cinematic Universe offers strong examples of racial and gender diversity? Has that changed over the film’s history? What other types of representation would you like to see in these movies? What will you miss most about this particular combination of Avengers? Which characters did you like best in this installment? Which characters surprised you the most? What Marvel-based stories do you hope they continue making?",
    "Film Review Avengers Endgame\n\nAvengers Endgame is Messy But Thematically Perfect The end is here. The Marvel Cinematic Universe wraps up its long-running Infinity Saga with the messy, convoluted, and thematically satisfying Avengers Endgame. The 22nd film in a franchise spanning over a decade, Marvel architects Joe and Anthony Russo compose a resonant coda to a story that began with 2008's Iron Man but also create a new breed of spectacle that defies criticism and filmmaking logic. Minor spoilers ahead.\n\nAvengers Endgame is critic-proof I'm not just talking about reviews and their impact on box office and attendance, but the film as an actual criticism-proof entity. As the long-anticipated conclusion to the decade-spanning Infinity Saga, directors Joe and Anthony Russo alongside their longtime writing partners, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have delivered a cultural event rather than a traditional cinema experience. The capstone to a 22-film franchise that started with Robert Downey Jr. uttering the words, 'I am Iron Man,' Avengers Endgame is a love letter to fans and an immensely satisfying parade of closure even if it doesn't exactly work as a singular movie.\n\nIn my review of its direct predecessor, Avengers Infinity War I wrote the following, 'So does Avengers Infinity War deliver? The answer is an unequivocal yes, but with some asterisks attached. If you're looking for coherence, laser-focused storytelling or even a compelling standalone film, you will likely be disappointed. The Russo brothers have crafted the ultimate superhero crossover, and while the prior 18 franchise films have at least made an effort to function by themselves so that they can be enjoyed independently, Infinity War makes no such concessions. There's barely time for exposition or even an emotional throughline with so many supergroups colliding together - instead, the film employs a workmanlike efficiency in guaranteeing that every major character gets a moment or two to shine a strategy that is more effective than you would think.'\n\nIf Avengers Infinity War used the MCU's storied library as a crutch, then its follow-up leans into it. Hard. The end of the Infinity Saga is a strange cinematic animal - a film that requires more than a passing familiarity with past entries to reap the rewards of its story. Endgame rarely feels like its own movie. Instead, with its payoffs, callbacks, and references, the Russo brothers have structured it as the ultimate prize for a decade of loyalty and fandom.\n\nAvengers Endgame is the first Marvel Studios film that feels like it actively punishes casual viewers and non-fans - and that is by design.\n\nThrough a film critic's lens, Endgame is a mess. Narratively wobbly, tonally inconsistent, and logically compromised, the film doubles down on Infinity War's entanglement with a decade's worth of superhero world-building with an uneven hand. But as a comic book and Marvel Cinematic Universe fan, the film is thematically perfect; a moving and epic conclusion that closes arcs and opens doors.\n\nAvengers Endgame begins where Infinity War left off, in the direct aftermath of Thanos' devastating snap that obliterated half of all life in the known universe. After a personal and bracing cold open that has tinges of HBO's The Leftovers, the film cuts to the Avengers as they wallow in their failure in a morose denouement. Tony Stark stranded in space with the blue meanie Nebula reflects upon the ill-fated battle that left his young charge Peter Parker a pile of dust while the rest of the Avengers deal with the repercussions on Earth. Grief, however, is quickly swept aside when our heroes locate the Mad Titan in his post-snap retirement on a distant planet. The Avengers' plan to exact revenge on Thanos and reverse the snap isn't exactly successful, and with one nastily brutal scene quite uncharacteristic of the MCU, the Russo brothers convey that Endgame won't be going the way that you expect.\n\nWithout spoiling the film further, the rest of the story uncovers a third chance at undoing the genocide wrought by the Infinity Gauntlet, leading to a whirlwind adventure that has our cast of heroes revisiting some of the MCU's greatest hits. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has always had an issue with consequence and forward momentum, a stubborn resistance to change and a tendency to rubber-band back to the status quo. In a franchise that has seen Nazis infiltrating the United States Government, superheroes bitterly fighting each other, and its ostensible lead blowing up all of his Iron Man suits, the MCU is surprisingly stagnant.\n\nPerhaps its resistance to change is a byproduct of the Disney corporate machine or perhaps it's an artifact of its comic book roots. The old adage goes, 'In comics, no one stays dead except for Uncle Ben, Jason Todd, and Bucky Barnes.' That may have been true two decades ago, but since then both Jason Todd and Bucky have returned to the land of the living. In the world of comics, you can have big events like The Death of Wolverine, but you know that Logan will always come back with his adamantium claws. Steve Rogers may pass on the mantle of Captain America, but you know he'll always return for that shield.\n\nComic book characters, through their inkers, colorists, and writers, are effectively immortal; actors, however, are not - contracts run their course, time passes and people age and yearn to move on. In Avengers Endgame, the Russo brothers utilize these limitations of a real-life comic book universe to devastating effect and perhaps for the first time we feel a narrative with finality and consequence. Where the first 21 films of the MCU have seemingly been in service of the 'to be continued,' not necessarily to its detriment, Endgame feels like a punctuation - from its closing character arcs to its emotional deaths, the film carries a weight rarely seen in superhero film. For the first time, a Marvel Studios film delivers a sobering message. Nothing lasts forever.\n\nFrom a narrative perspective, Avengers Endgame doesn't always work. Its tendency to jump from hilarious one-liner to deadly serious business induces a sharp tonal whiplash, and I'm pretty sure the logic around the film's core mechanic is far from airtight, but damn if it isn't satisfying.\n\nWith half of the universe dusted, Endgame gets to focus on our original six Avengers plus some stragglers from Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, Hulk, and especially Captain America and Iron Man. Everyone gets their moment in the sun. And whether these moments make you laugh, cheer, or cry, they all land in the places the Russos want. To call the film a walking personification of fan-service would be accurate but also a little unfair. While your run-of-the-mill fan-service acts as little nods and fun Easter eggs, Endgame utilizes it to pay off character arcs and splash jaw-dropping moments across the cinema screen many of them moments that comic book fans have been anticipating for over a decade.\n\nIt's no hyperbole to call Avengers Endgame a cultural event rather than a film - it's a superhero epic that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible with the biggest crowd possible.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe is an incredible beast, a feat of world-building and consistent storytelling that has captivated audiences all around the world. With Avengers Endgame, Kevin Feige along with the Russo brothers have stuck the landing on a decade's worth of stories. Like Infinity War, the film may not operate fully on its own, but its predecessors have paved the way for an immensely satisfying conclusion. The MCU is the ultimate long game and Endgame feels like its glorious final lap"
