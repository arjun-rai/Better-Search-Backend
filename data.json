            "movie_reviews_for_Avengers_Endgame": "Avengers Endgamethe 22nd movie to emerge from the Marvel Cinematic Universe birth canal and the capper to the two-part saga that began with last years Avengers Infinity Warmakes more sense as an event than as a movie The film has been meticulously crafted for people who care deeply about these characters and its likely most of those viewers will leave the theater satisfied Directors Anthony and Joe Russo also the directors of Avengers Infinity War as well as two of the Captain America films and their team of writers have ensured with machinelike precision that each Avenger gets his or her proper allotment of sensitive moments as well as heroic ones Once in a while Endgame is enjoyable on its own terms though mostly youll be better off if you have at least a rough working knowledge of the MCU movies that have preceded it Its an entertainment designed to please many many people and disappoint as few as possible extravagant without necessarily having a vision beyond its desire not to put a foot wrong Its bold in the safest possible way In other words as movies that are part of multi-billion-dollar franchises go Avengers Endgame is good enough I must note here that I have little invested in the Marvel movies as the result of any attachment to Marvel comics But I do care about the work of the actors who appear in them performers like Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson Chadwick Boseman and Robert Downey Jr Zoe Saldana and Jeremy Renner All of these people have been terrific in MCU movies even when they could easily get by with being less than terrific Watching Endgame I realized that I do care about Marvel characters because these actors have made me care The skill those actorsalong with some I havent mentioned like Tessa Thompson and Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatchbring to the Marvel movies in general and to Avengers Endgame specifically only makes me wish these movies were breezier and more inventive and less obsessed with the high-stakes big-money fan-pleasing game But you cant have everything and Endgame at least gives these actors something to work with Minor-to-moderate spoilers follow so if you want to experience Endgame with the na√Øve blankness of a tadpole freshly launched into the pond please stop reading here Endgame opens with an unnerving gracefully filmed prologue involving Renners Clint Barton Hawkeye when in his superhero guise Hes enjoying an outdoor picnic with his family when it becomes clear that what were seeing is a moment connected to the tail end of Infinity War The instant supervillain Thanos Josh Brolin snapped his fingersafter having captured the last of those six all-powerful nuggets known as the Infinity Stonesand destroyed exactly half the worlds population leaving the other half to grieve and remember Its more cruel when you think about it to destroy half the world than all of it This megalomaniacal act was Thanoss way of cleansing what he viewed as a corrupt universe But Hawkeye having retreated from Avengers duty to be a family man wasnt around to witness Thanoss big finaleand as Endgame begins he doesnt yet know that half his friends have turned to dust And so in this moment we know whats going to happen before Hawkeye does He turns away from his family for just a millisecond and in a blink theyre gone Next we see the other remaining Avengers pulling themselves together after the tragedyor in the case of Scott Lang/Antman Paul Rudd just waking up after a Quantum Realm-induced nap Lang quickly gets up to speed on what he missed and comes up with the germ of a plan Might the Avengers go back in time to foil Thanoss plan of half-destruction Lang introduces his idea to remaining Avengers Steve Rogers/Captain America Evans Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow Johansson and James Rhodes/War Machine Cheadle They bring this spark of an idea to the guy who might be able to make it work Downeys Tony Stark/Iron Man who barely survived Thanoss destructathon First Stark says its impossible then he changes his mindbut he also worries that if the scheme doesnt work hell lose all hes gained in what has for him become a bittersweet time an era during which hes mourning his lost friends but also starting a new life for himself The plan to turn back time is less a major plot point than a mechanism to keep the story clicking and the middle sectionin which the Avengers break into groups to travel to specific places and years where they can grab one Infinity Stone or another before Thanos can get his dirty mitts on any of themis the movies finest Avengers Endgame is a better movie than Avengers Infinity War in one important sense It relies less on milking tears out of us for characters who have died but who we know will come back againtheyre too valuable to the franchise to be gone for good than on focusing on what each of these characters might mean to us given our history with them The mid-section of Endgame shows the Avengers actors at their best Chris Hemsworth as a Thor who has slid into a state of pot-bellied depression post-Thanos gets a chance to reunite with his long-dead mother Frigga Rene Russo in the kingdom of his birth Asgard He greets her tentatively almost shyly nearly dumbfounded by the gift of seeing her again even for a few moments she discreetly asks about his funky eye The tenderness between them is lush and quiet underscoring whats most valuable about Endgame There is only one gargantuan booming fight scene and its not the centerpiece of the movie Its as if the Russo brothers have finally acknowledged that bigger noisier battles amount to less rather than more At least we can hope Endgame does give us some arresting visuals Thompsons Valkyrie riding on a winged horse anyone But generally the actors are Endgames finest special effect Though were made to wait for the entrance of Bosemans TChalla/Black Panther its worth it He coasts into the movie on a regal cloud And Robert Downey after playing Tony Stark/Iron Man for perhaps too many years snaps back into form In the 2008 Iron Man Downey brought a kind of frazzled elegance to the role of Starkhis nervous energy seemed to spark from his fingertips as if it were too much for his body to contain In the years since his Iron Man performances have become more brittle more reliant on tics But in Endgame Starks moments of doubt feel lived-inDowneys performance is alive with prickly uncertainty Even when Endgame hits its generally predictable beats you can still count on the actors to shift the mood into slightly uncomfortable emotional territory The Russos and their writers clearly took pains to give nearly each character a gratifying arc and a properif not necessarily softplace to land That must have been a lot of work and a few of the Avengers get short shrift The ever-so-powerful Captain Marvel Brie Larson drops out of the movie for a long stretch eventually returning witha short haircut Some arc But the Russos more than make up for that with the discreet wistful coda they give Steve Rogers/Captain America Its the movies single most gorgeous element perfectly fitting for a guy who entered a 70-year sleep right after finding the love of his life Evans Captain America has always been physically speaking the beefiest of all the Avengers as sturdy and wholesome as the after picture in a Charles Atlas ad Yet Evans has also always been one of the most understated actors in the franchise As Steve Evans smile is easy friendly in a stock all-American way But theres never been any swagger behind it Its the smile of a guy whos lost something valuable whose view of the future is perpetually tinted with the color of what he left behind Avengers Endgame isnt a great movie but there are flashes of greatness in it and quite a few of them belong to Evans His Captain America rewards us with a revelation and escapes with a secret The best thing in Avengers Endgame is everything

            "movie_reviews_for_Avengers_Endgame": "Last years Avengers Infinity War was as finely calibrated a piece of action cinema as youre ever likely to see with a vast host of characters taking their turn upon the stage There each one generally did something awesome during their moment in the spotlight and passed the metaphorical baton gracefully to the next comer You might expect more of the same in the Endgame that now follows but this time Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered a stranger scrappier beast This deals with the messy business of emotional fallout and character development The trick is that it does so in a way thats equally satisfying and that the action when it comes is less precise but far more impactful Marvel fans wont be surprised to learn that most of the clips youve glimpsed in the trailer come in the first 15 minutes of the movie and were given to you a little out of context But virtually everything that you havent seen in that 15 minutes will surprise you and thats just the prelude This entire first act is primarily about coping with grief and loss and the many different forms that takes All five stages of grief are here somewhere though no-one has made it all the way through depression to complete acceptance As Steve Rogers Chris Evans said even in the trailers Some people move on But not us Nothing is safe until everything is safe nothing is over until its really completely over Theyre struggling even those whose lives and families were ostensibly left untouched Steve may run to a returning Tonys Robert Downey Jr side both united in failure but theres still bad blood between them and Steves attempts to hold up everyone elses morale are clearly paper-thin covers for his own vast despair Rocket Bradley Cooper and Thor Chris Hemsworth may still crack wise but theyre barely functional without the support networks that once sustained them And Hawkeye Jeremy Renner is taking out his fury at the universe and at an unreachable Thanos on any criminal who had the temerity to survive when his family did not Theres alcoholism depression drastic lifestyle changes and simple avoidance of things too painful to face So yes expect metaphorical gut punches galore in this early section before they come up with a plan that just might work to put things right and deliver a satisfying gut punch to the purple bastard who ruined the universe But its surprisingly funny even in its darkest moments I get emails from a raccoon so nothing seems crazy anymore says Natasha Scarlett Johansson wryly Tony and Rhodey Don Cheadle snark dependably and Thor delivers a piece of er call it physical comedy that subverts expectation brilliantly and offers one of the biggest laughs of the entire franchise If the theme of the last film was We dont trade lives Vision this one is all about responsibility and self-sacrifice and being willing to do whatever it takes to win the day Its a battle between the past and future and an argument about which one we should do more to protect Here nothing is safe until everything is safe nothing is over until its really completely over This is not just about getting the gang back together but taking the time to share knowledge form a plan and work as a team in order to do some actual avenging for once Its a long film but it doesnt feel it even with all these talky scenes We get a steady stream of returning characters and not only heroes who ensure your interest never has a chance to wane the cast of this film is an indie directors fever dream an embarrassment of riches that is well invested at key moments Inevitably a few characters are underserved with Rocket Okoye Danai Gurira and maybe even Natasha short a scene or two while others get far more than before but its hard to see what else could have been cut without losing something important Cap in particular becomes the heart of this film in a big way Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely came up through his films and let the love show here though to be fair this is a film that trips back through characters moments and lines from the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe back catalogue Then there is the action There are a few feints early on that skew far from the expected template but the big brawl that finishes that had to finish this is one for the ages The action sometimes moves a little too fast to really grasp but theres so much to entertain that it seems unfair to complain Its punctuated by moments of pure giddy delight that put Thors arrival in Wakanda into the shade and moments of emotion that hit hard if this is fan service okay its definitely fan service its exceptionally well deployed Except maybe for one nod to grrrl power that is uncharacteristically clumsy That moment doesnt drag it down for long theres too much else happening that is awesome Sure theres a touch of Return Of The King syndrome creeping in at the end Sure the plot has a particular breed of logic hole that you could drive a bus through You wont care Were never going to object to another five minutes in the company of this company",

            "movie_reviews_for_Avengers_Endgame": "cool tribute posters pictured in the article are by artist TurksWork Hola Dannie aqui Yesterday morning I had the pleasure of seeing AVENGERS ENDGAME at an advance press screening here in the Austin Texas hill country I have purposefully avoided the leaked footage as I hate spoilers low-quality resolution and seeing footage out of context It has been hard trying to quell the temptation to see the footage curiosity killed the cat and avoiding talking to those friends and family that gave into the tantalizing click bait The night before the screening I watched Avengers Infinity War on a loop until I fell asleep dreaming of the possibilities that await the surviving members of the Marvel-verse So when I awoke to journey forth to the super secret press screening with my best friend of over twenty years and fellow Marvel maniac I was primed and ready to have my mind blown yet again by our surviving beloved heroes I went into AVENGERS ENDGAME with high hopes expectations and the fangirl dream that maybe just maybe we might get a glimpse or tease of a possible Fantastic Four film There is not a trace of the FF in Endgame which is a bummer however the film is spectacular Maybe they are saving the Fantastic Four for a movie based during the space race of the 50s and 60s Although through some magical way I shall not explain some of our heroes end up in this era in Endgame Which still left me hopeful for an eventual FF film Now diving into the AVENGERS ENDGAME review I am going to try my best to keep this review spoiler free That will not be an easy endeavor as this film is filled with such a twisting turning loop de loop filled roller coaster of hilarity humanity heartbreak and has epically jaw-dropping visuals that will cause elation and woe The theater we were in was a little over half filled with critics and company During multiple parts of the film the theater erupted in harmonious laughter gasps cheers as well as sniffles and tears It was as if the audience were all members of a symphony and AVENGERS ENDGAME was a conductor cueing us emotionally into captive moments of silent appreciation as well as moments of making active and audible responses AVENGERS ENDGAME is genuinely a remarkable film The myriad of emotional manipulation throughout the story and how they balance the overall visual aesthetics were masterfully handled In my opinion Endgame is far superior to Thor Ragnarok as far as laughs and is just as good as any of the Guardians of the Galaxy films as far as a naturally flowing and believable dialog between the charismatic characters The universe we are introduced to after Thanos snap is one of devastation and the surviving heroes are all massively traumatized by the overwhelming and calamitous loss A character that never really got his time in the limelight is Clint Barton/Hawkeye actor Jeremy Renner finally was given the depth and time needed to make a mental connection with viewers truly None of you are even remotely prepared for where the Hulk and Thor are at post snap there just are no words for it other than hysterical laughter gasps and silent awe Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow was also given an ample and vital role in Endgame again bringing added depth to the character Paul Rudds Ant-Man plays a pivotal part in Endgame and is as charming as ever The tension between Iron Man and Captian America is so thick you can cut it with a knife Nebula actress Karen Gillan is a complete and utterly badass character that I have loved watching unfold throughout the Guardians of the Galaxy films as well as the last Avengers flick and Endgame just gives you more of the tortured tech melded Nebula in all her glory to chew on Rocket Raccoon is visually aged by the loss of his crew the only family he had however is as cynical and crafty as ever Captain Marvel is not a character of focus more of a deus ex machina written character appearing mainly for crucial moments and battles All in all I think the vast majority of theatergoers and Marvel madmen and ladies will love AVENGERS ENDGAME as it is a highly enjoyable blast through time and space that will leave you immediately wanting to rewatch the overwhelmingly kick-ass film For me the film knocked it out of the park on every level possible and is proof that Marvel is continuing to raise its bar and annihilate competition at the box office I hope I didnt drop too many hints and or spoilers and this is a hard one to not spoil as its a bombardment of coolness and twists I can not wait to see AVENGERS ENDGAME again and I am contemplating writing up a spoiler-filled review as well after its release on the 26th of this month Rejoice fanboys and girls AVENGERS ENDGAME is coming to melt your marvelous minds Stay Strong Live Good Love Movies Dannie HL Knowles aka Pekosa Peligrosa",

            "movie_reviews_for_Avengers_Endgame": "I loved Avengers Endgame 2019 Not every second of it not every aspect of it But overall I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching this movie Shock Value When discussing Avengers Endgame with my brother to be a brother you often have a brother yeah this is what he said When President Trump won the race for President for the first time in my life I had a feeling like Is this real life Is this the timeline of society I live in The only other time I experienced something like that feeling was when Marvel Studios actually included that freakin snap at the end of Avengers Infinity War 2018 I glimpsed a feeling Wow did Disney just do this For real Nearly the entire time I watched Avengers Endgame I felt something like a continuation of that feeling I agree with my brother The script for Avengers Endgame resembled the crazy no-rules approach to writing so often found in superhero comics but typically lacking in the film adaptations of those comics which tend to use simplistic conservative scripts I felt like I was watching a comic book movie for the first time The experience of this movie was different from any Marvel or superhero film that has come before far different even than its at-the-time-shocking precursor Avengers Infinity War 2018 As I watched Avengers Endgame I felt like the directors and writers held nothing in reserve They took huge risks with the characters and included almost every character development idea they could think of at least for the characters Marvel is phasing out Some of these ideas I predicted Iron Man dying time travel but many took me by surprise like the heroes executing Thanos at the beginning1I do mean execute because Thanos did not resist the heroes or physically defend himself the heroes had captured him and Thor just chopped his head off The film quickly established that the infinity stones were destroyed impossible in the comics and killed off Thanos a wild idea also not in the comics so I thought to myself What will this 3-hour movie even be about These initial shocking moments drew me into the story And shocking moments continued throughout the film Avengers Age of Ultron 2015 teased the possibility that Steve Rogers could be worthy of wielding Thors hammer but I never expected him to actually pick it up As my brother put it I saw Thor Iron Man and Captain America fighting Thanos and I was thinking Man Captain America isnt even relevant poor guy What else can he do though and in that exact second when I counted him out he called the hammer and takes on Thanos by himself This is one of the best moments in the cinematic history of fight scenes or at least for superhero movies Unlike its predecessors Avengers Endgame did not feel chained to anything not to the comics not to the previous movies despite their critical and commercial success and certainly not to genre conventions How could the capstone movie of the most popular most money-making film franchise in history disregard the straightforward predictable structures and ideas of its predecessors I dont know but it was awesome The film did not care at all about conventions in a very good way I felt like I was watching something pure pure in many senses of the word What Was Avengers Endgame about I want to say that it wasnt about anything really other than itself The script the feelings the characters almost everything in the film makes no sense at all unless youve watched nearly every single MCU movie And even if you can comprehend what is happening the movie has many emotional moments that only work if you care about the characters and what had been established in many of the previous films not just Infinity War Other than the Snappening the content of Infinity War had little impact on the story half of all people being dead had a huge impact on the plot but other than the snap and its aftermath the specific events of Infinity War were not referenced much Theres a long second act the first act ending with the timeskip dealing with the aftereffects of the Snapture which is probably the bravest aspect of the movie The script follows up on the most disturbing idea from Infinity War by examining the consequences of a death lottery losing a devastating war and a soft apocalypse all in a realistic way The characters go to therapy succumb to depression decide to retire and cant move past what has happened to their lives I am fascinated that this action movie examines feelings like sadness regret and despair through something other than violence the characters spend a lot of time just talking to each other about how they feel of course plenty of them resort to violence as well The length of this act contributed significantly to the 3-hour runtime of the movie but I think the directors made the right choice to include this character development and world-building The Time Heist Then we get to the third act the Time Heist The Time Heist was an incredible idea because the time travel element allowed the film to traverse ideas from many of the previous movies in a literal way Rather than just following up on or referencing the previous films we got to see them in the style of Back to the Future Part 2 1989 This raised the feeling of comic-book-ness to stratospheric heights because going back to old locations ideas parallel universes or the past is far easier to do in comic books because the artists just draw the events than live action where maintaining continuity bringing back actors etc is a logistical nightmare Somehow the studio made it happen Theres more to the brilliance of the Time Heist these scenes harmonized intelligently many contradictory or confusing ideas established across the different MCU movies For example the idea that SHIELD was riddled with HYDRA moles was not established until Captain America Winter Soldier 2014 But when the heroes went back in time to the events of The Avengers 2012 the writing acknowledged that the HYDRA moles would have been present at that time This kind of writing when done sloppily is often criticized as a retcon retroactive continuity But when it is done well as in Endgame it is hard to even notice If you pay attention though you might notice more than a dozen examples of this thoughtful harmonization What Im trying to say here is that Endgame did not just reference the specific movies that the heroes traveled back in time to get infinity stones from the movie brought together everything that could be plausibly referenced from every other MCU movie even though these movies were made years apart by different teams Thus Avengers Endgames Time Heist sequence brought a greater level of cohesion to the MCU than weve ever seen which is already by far the most cohesive of any movie universe attempted Technically speaking I think the Time Heist was the most ambitious part of the movie The filmmakers needed to get together a huge number of specific actors maintain continuity with all the previous movies and edit together an extremely convoluted narrative That all could have been a disaster but they hit a home run When I ask my friends what their favorite moment was from the movie nearly all of them pick something from the Time Heist Thanos In Avengers Infinity War 2018 Thanos prattled at length about his ridiculous Malthusian beliefs Thomas Malthus was a pre-industrial English demographer who more than 200 years ago falsely predicted world-wide starvation as a consequence of population growth World-wide hunger rates continue to decline but somehow I never stop meeting people who embrace this pseudo-science Although Infinity War spends a lot of time letting Thanos explain his insane perspective none of the heroes was given a moment to even state that Malthusian beliefs are false as a matter of science In the comics Thanoss Malthusian assertions were never treated as fact If I recall correctly comic book Thanos murdered everyone on his home world Titan but in Infinity War his backstory is changed to prove his Malthusian beliefs Paradoxically and reversing the morality of the comics the Titans died not because Thanos murdered them but because he didnt Thus Infinity War allowed Thanoss beliefs to stand as a harsh truth that must be resisted solely because murder is wrong and not because Thanos is insane and/or an idiot Please peruse these excerpts from the comics In the comics the hero Silver Surfer is basically making fun of Thanoss stupid Malthusian ideas We understand that Thanos is not just brutal not just a sociopath not just a murderer but also a madman 2Hence the moniker the Mad Titan In my opinion omitting any kind of counter-argument to what Thanos believes is a horrible flaw in the script for Infinity War which clearly draws ideas from Silver Surfer 35 1990 Infinity War portrayed Thanos as a misunderstood anti-villain who had the courage to live out his terrible destiny The script for Avengers Endgame reigned in this Malthusian bullcrap and did a great job wrapping up the characterization for Thanos Endgame shows us unequivocally that Thanos enjoys killing We experience Thanos as a narcissistic psychopath who apparently enjoys watching footage of his own death Endgame shows that Thanos will change his perspective to suit his goal of killing people rationalizing his absurd goals just like he does in the comics Thanos was just as willing to kill 100 of all people as 50 showing that for all his charisma he was nothing more than a simple murderer This brings him a lot closer to the comic book version that I prefer Putting Thanos into a minor role was a big shift from the previous Avengers movie in which he was practically the main character Endgame took a lot of risks with this popular villain killing him off returning him but only as a simplified past version and this was a good choice Infinity War hardly seemed deserving of the Avengers title but Endgame was definitely about the Avengers specifically the original six The two movies Infinity War and Endgame even though they are technically sequential feel much more like parallel stories The first is told from the perspective of Thanos and the second is told from the perspective of everyone else Infinity War gave us time to understand Thanoss motivations his ambition his conviction and so on Endgame shows us how nearly everyone doesnt understand like or benefit from anything Thanos did or ever would do From the perspective of others Thanos is a remorseless evildoer who hardly even deserves the swift death meted out to him by the heroes Watching Endgame I felt like heroes who think like Captain America are needed to protect us from villains who think like Thanos The Worst Problem I liked the endings for most of the characters By a big margin though Black Widow was the most poorly-treated character In The Avengers 2012 Loki describes Black Widow as a mewling quim an archaic term for female genitalia In Avengers Age of Ultron 2015 Black Widow describes herself as a monster because her assassin training involved her sterilization And in Avengers Endgame 2019 Black Widow throws herself off a cliff because Hawkeye sired children and her body has produced none Good grief A disappointing ending for a character that has always been a poorly-written disappointment Thats a real shame since Black Widow was the first and for a while the only female MCU hero The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny The final act calls to mind an old Neil Cicierega parody song The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny My brother loved the final act At the end when the whole crew starts showing up Thanos is like whatever dont care And then there are more and hes like wait a second who are all these people jesus More keep coming and hes like am I screwed I love this scene Of course the emotional satisfaction of seeing all the characters come together felt earned because the heroes had worked so hard and risked so much to make this moment happen but the directors decision to show Thanoss reaction made this scene even more gripping and satisfying That final battle visually resembled a combination of the final battles from the previous movie in Wakanda and on Titan I liked how in this way and other ways the two movies pair together well I enjoyed seeing Thanos using his weapon and armor I would have paid the full ticket price just to watch Captain America 1v1 Thanos for 2 minutes I also liked that there was a moment when all the female heroes gathered together I had forgotten how many there are I enjoyed the suspenseful buildup during the Time Heist that past-Thanos was aware of what the heroes were up to His character was written as so smart capable and dangerous that even him just knowing that the heroes are up to something is terrifying Of course he sneaks through the time machine with his ship army and all his allies I found myself thinking Theres no way that they can beat Thanoss unified forces they couldnt beat that army or Thanos the last time around and the heroes are far weaker than before This tension created a true need for all the heroes from all the previous movies to return and assemble My favorite idea from this final act is that the heroes victory and the heroes defeat are so closely linked The heroes need to build a new infinity gauntlet in order to restore the lives extinguished by Thanos in the last movie but in doing so the heroes create the possibility that Thanos will kill everyone So even though the heroes are so close to triumph they are also as close to an even greater defeat as they can possibly get What a clever idea for the script The final battle is so freakin close The Avengers and the forces of Thanos appear evenly matched this time It all comes down to the final possession of the infinity stones I felt like I was watching a football game with a tied score with everything coming down to a trick play and an interception the crowd going wild anything about to happen I felt like I really did not know what would happen because of all the craziness that had ensued up until that point A Second Viewing With so many weird ideas undergirding Avengers Endgame shocking script ideas a time skip time travel dead characters unusual tone and pacing etc the movie could have been a trainwreck To be sure Endgame was not the best or my favorite MCU movie but considering how different it was and considering how many risks the directors took Endgame may be the most intriguing Endgame deserves some kind of merit badge for taking the most risks and turning out to be a pretty good movie I certainly like it more than any of the previous Avengers movies The movie earned its 3-hour run-time3I could have used an intermission though I did not find any moment dull There were so many good lines I liked almost every joke and so much to take in I think the movie deserves a second viewing4In particular now that I know what actually happens I would like to pay more attention to the performances of the actors I am pretty sure that Robert Downey Jrs performance is amazing just because it is somehow believable especially if you consider that in many scenes hes looking at almost nothing at all because its all CGId in during post production",

ENDGAME is set after Thanos catastrophic use of the Infinity Stones randomly wiped out half of Earths population in Avengers Infinity War Those left behind are desperate to do something -- anything -- to bring back their lost loved ones But after an initial attempt -- with extra help from Captain Marvel Brie Larson -- creates more problems than solutions the grieving purposeless Avengers think all hope is lost Theyre reenergized by the eventual reappearance of Scott Lang aka Ant-Man Paul Rudd who was stuck in the quantum realm during the fight on Wakanda He believes there could be a way to

Black Widow Scarlett Johansson the Hulk Mark Ruffalo Rocket Bradley Cooper Nebula Karen Gillan Hawkeye Jeremy Renner and Ant-Man team up for one last life-or-death mission to outsmart Thanos Josh Brolin and save the universe Is It Any Good The Russo brothers poignant powerful finale more than lives up to the hype Its a thrilling conclusion and a deeply emotional exploration of loss and love duty and honor friendship and family Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely the story focuses on the remaining Avengers and their post-trauma lives Each seems overwhelmed by their failure so when they start to regroup its clear that theyre far from the same confident optimistic superheroes who thought they could defeat Thanos in Infinity War The dads in the group are particularly effective at showing how personal the grief is providing a contrast to the general sense of failure and loss that the single superheroes feel As the often underappreciated Hawkeye Renner stands out in a crowded field of immense talent for making his character feel central His intensity and his platonic brotherly love for Natasha/Black Widow is perfectly conveyed Johansson does a lot of the emotionally resonant work in the movie keeping tabs on everyone encouraging her friends and acting like everyones favorite sister except in the Hulks case The big three -- Iron Man Captain America and Thor -- are also fabulous Their differences have never been more obvious but each proves that despite past conflicts and heartbreaks theyre worthy and ready to fight side by side Theres so much packed into the three hours of Avengers Endgame that it might seem overwhelming at times this is clearly a film that will inspire repeat viewing There are unexpected twists and moments of hilarity as well as more serious scenes and themes Those well-versed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will delight in the many Easter eggs and clear fan service yes theres still a Stan Lee cameo while more casual fans will still find plenty of reasons to applaud Whats also true is that the three-hour movie brings all the feels Just when one gut-punching beat finishes theres barely enough of a break for a zinger from Tony or Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper before another oh no moment squeezes your heart But dont despair This is a bittersweet example that the best heroes wont allow hubris or insecurity to defeat them Endgame ranks up there with The Return of the King and Deathly Hallows Part 2 -- all are epic emotional and exceptional franchise finales Talk to Your Kids About Families can talk about

            "movie_reviews_for_Avengers_Endgame": "Avengers Endgame 2019 Movie Review Boo Zero Stars Just kidding I thought that Id give some fellow nerds a brief heart attack Good start I like to think so In All Seriousness What are you reading this for Why arent you out at the theater watching Avengers Endgame for the tenth time The rest of the world seems to be doing that right now whats wrong with you Or did the theater owner kick you out to help ease yourself out of this addiction youre struggling with Damn Marvel junkie Alright Im Done Being An Ass Now this time in all seriousness this may be the absolute most pointless review I will ever write in my life Quite literally everyone has probably already seen Endgame multiple times over and it hasnt even been out a full week yet I debated internally on whether or not to bother writing a review at all its a very solid flick that is already getting more than enough attention Then I thought about it a little more realizing that maybe I do have a take on critiquing this movie that no one else really can write That being my own personal journey getting to where we are now in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as of 2019 2008 In 2008 I had little to no clue as to who the hell Iron Man/Tony Stark was A rich guy that fought crime in a costume I already had Batman how was Iron Man going to make much of an impression on me Through the power of Robert Downey Jr thats how When the first Iron Man film came out I was 16 years old and was pretty skeptical going into it then coming out of it my family and I basically found the movie that wed watch together on a weekly basis for a very long time We had a genuine blast watching Jon Favreaus Iron Man again and again when it made it to home video Any time it popped up on TV there was no need to continue channel surfing Any time we were bored and didnt have much else going on we threw that sucker right into the DVD player Hell wed go to sleep watching that movie almost on a nightly basis simply because it was that enjoyable of a movie for us We loved it and couldnt get enough of it At this point Im honestly not entirely sure if that DVD works anymore We must have worn that thing out at this point Downey is incredible in the charismatically sarcastic role of Tony Stark a role that was practically made for him The action was exciting and looked spectacular we hadnt seen special effects put on such a enormous scale in quite some time and it was unbelievable for us to witness The cherry on top was always the RoboCop reference I loved that I love that movie and to this day it still holds a soft spot in my heart However as spectacular Iron Man was I had no idea it would escalate to become something even bigger 2010  2019 Ive seen this cinematic universe grow from a single fun superhero movie to a total juggernaut amongst the globe Its rather astonishing thinking back to when I thought that there was no way Marvel was ever going to get this shared universe pieced together Theres no way that we will ever see these dominating hero personalities work off each other in a single movie Theres no way to make a guy running around in a star spangled banner costume not laughable Theres no way that theyll be able to make a movie with a talking raccoon and a tree man actually good Theres no way Ant-Man could ever hit it off with general audiences Theres no way this big purple dude is going to live up to all this build-up and hype around him after several movies of teasing Theres no way theres ever going to be a Black Widow movie okay that last one presently still holds up to be true Pretty much every time I have uttered the claim theres no way Marvel has found a way to shove it back in my face Color me wildly impressed especially with their movie track record holding far more hits than misses as well Sure there have been a few films in the Marvel line-up that I havent much cared for In all honesty there hasnt been a single MCU flick that Id ever consider being a truly bad film though There are the occasional letdowns but the worst quality that an MCU movie has ever reached for me was simply just okay Not terrible just okay with usually enough entertainment value to always carry me through somehow The rest of the world may disagree with me on that but Im rather convinced that a lot of those people have never seen an real bad film such as Nukie The Trump Prophecy or any Dinesh DSouza documentary either Endgame So here it is eleven years in the making has all led up to this in my opinion it did not disappoint In case you are wondering there will probably not be any spoilers in this review At least Im not planning to spoil anything at this time if that changes though I promise to put up a warning prior to said spoiler Avengers Endgame may possibly be the most epic superhero movie that I have personally ever experienced The action sequences in this particularly the final battle is the definition of epic Its big its bold and it is a full three hour rollercoaster ride of fun In terms of the story sadly since the actual plot of this movie seems to have been hidden in all of the marketing and really doesnt reveal itself until well into the actual movie I also feel obligated to withhold that information All I will say for what the film is about is that the Avengers have to deal with the aftermath of what Thanos did at the end of Infinity War I wish I could go more into detail but since the advertising refused to share that info then I guess I will to Structure To touch a little bit on the structure of the film there are certain story beats that one would expect to happen going into Endgame and they would be right but how and when they happen will catch the viewers off guard The Avengers themselves dont mess around when trying to resolve their issue right off the bat it was rather refreshing to see how the first act had the Avengers trying to get things done Making for a somewhat unpredictable narrative especially when it does throw in some twists and turns that I genuinely was not expecting Even though Endgame is three hours long that is not an exaggeration as it is literally three hours long it strangely enough breezed by I didnt leave my seat once and never felt a single pain in my ass while my eyes were glued to the screen The pacing of the movie keeps up the momentum to ensure that there is at least something interesting or funny or suspenseful or emotionally driven going on within every scene It justifies every minute of screen time that it has which is difficult for some flicks that are only an hour and a half long let alone twice that length That is no easy feat but Endgame accomplishes it pretty well and it feels like the film earns that length This is the epidemy of everything this series of films have built up to over a decade now a film like this required the length to give a truly satisfying conclusion to the story I have to emphasize though that this is not a movie for a casual viewer to blindly walk into Honestly if someone has only seen like two or three of the MCU flicks they are going to be lost here This is a movie that significantly relies on the audience having full knowledge of where these characters have been and all that theyve gone through in order to understand as to who what and why certain things happen in Endgame So I strongly urge anyone who isnt all that familiar with this franchise to not go blindly into Avengers Endgame Seriously you will need to do your homework before going into a movie like this Not to say that makes Endgame bad to not be more easily accessible to the casual viewer it just simply is the type of film that has a lot going on in it and it would simply be ridiculous to add another hour explaining the twenty other movies that came prior for the select few that havent seen them The Characters Avengers Infinity War was sort of an ensemble film with a major emphasis on the character of Thanos Avengers Endgame is much more of a pure ensemble with everyone getting about the same amount of screen time dedication Because of that we get what feels like an evenly balanced film that provides enough focus on our cast to receive the arcs and dignified conclusions that they deserve When I say conclusions I dont necessarily mean death so dont start thinking that I mean everyone is going to die with that said characters die Going into this film you should expect there to be some casualties thats just common sense I wont say who bites the dust I didnt mean to put a pun there but Im leaving it in However I will say that there are a couple of scenes that really got to me emotionally Seeing all of these characters grow over the years I slowly fell in love with all of their personalities and its difficult not to feel something when some of which meet their end In the theater it was kind of amazing to be there as the collective sobbing and sniffling to specific events that occur was practically in surround sound for me Children and adults alike That is how powerfully these characters have seemed to impact our society crying in unison when a comic book character meets their fate And it is sad its very sad It is also earned when things like that happen and it never feels like a cheap move to manipulate the audience It feels sincere How all of these characters are emotionally dealing with the events of Infinity War feels personal and investing to watch I loved how Hawkeye Jeremy Renner is effected by the snap from the previous movie and he goes out seeking his own vengeance Tony Stark Robert Downey Jr and the revelations that he has after Infinity War were extremely relatable and had me really curious to see how he would handle certain situations Thors Chris Hemsworth character arc was a bit on the sillier side at the same time I still had a good time watching him so I didnt have any real problem there Steve Rogers/Captain America Chris Evans I believe had one of the more bittersweet scenes to occur with his character and it really worked for me in a lesser film I would have possibly called foul here it seemingly works Everyone really has a beautiful moment or more to shine in Endgame it payed a lot of attention to our heroes this time around to ensure that everything was done as respectfully as possible The only characters I was honestly somewhat underwhelmed by were that of Thanos Josh Brolin and Captain Marvel Brie Larson Which was a little surprising to me seeing how I thought Thanos was one of the best villains that the MCU had brought to the table in a good long while with Infinity War and last month I had an incredibly good time with Captain Marvel and absolutely adored the title character This time around they both have very little screen time and dont have much going for them I never disliked their characters but they were easily the least interesting parts of the entire movie Which is sort of disappointing since I really wanted more out of Thanos since he was such a well-developed and intriguing personality to witness before while Captain Marvel was a likable badass chick with cool powers Sadly I got little to nothing from them here Thanos at least has a couple of decent lines and scenes sprinkled occasionally not so much Captain Marvel Shes practically barely even in this quite frankly If there are any substantial criticisms I have with Endgame its that these two characters should have been given much more development here - Captain Marvel 2019 A Space-Cop Movie Review Vers is a space cop with amnesia and she has to take on shape-shifting aliens with the help of Nick Fury to save the galaxy The Effects I would say that the majority of Marvels CGI work since 2008 has always been relatively solid since the very beginning Endgame certainly holds up in that department in providing some glorious comic book visuals Every action set piece and visual effect is convincing and a blast to watch the explosively bombastic chaos ensue towards the third act If memory serves me right I cant recall any specific moment that stood out as a bad special effect although it was a three hour sit with probably 85 of which being digitally finger printed somewhere As you can imagine thats a lot to process but Im doing my best here For the most part it is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and delivers on all the thrills and excitement that one could ever hope for in a film like this Of Course I Recommend It Was that really a question at this point in the review Of course I recommend Avengers Endgame Its a damn good movie and possibly one of the biggest major event theater experiences that any of us may ever witness for a comic book flick The story and pacing holds the viewers attention with ease most of the characters have fantastic writing to supply plenty of laughs and a few tears as well the action has tremendous big screen spectacle written all over it Endgame is simply a fantastically fun popcorn flick Now if I were to analytically break this film down with a magnifying glass to inspect every single nook and cranny would I find more flaws within its story or what have you Definitely If one were to think about certain things too much they could find endless amounts of plot holes and details that dont quite add up Especially with a film that deals with the specific genre it is placing itself in That stuff doesnt bug me if Im having a good time with the movie A personal gripe I may have though is that Endgame has a slight issue with tone Sometimes it flows perfectly fine then other times it becomes rather flimsy attempting to bebop back and forth between being comical and being serious That in all honesty was fairly minor and mainly remained consistent For myself as long as something doesnt take me out of my enjoyment and I am being entertained by the movie Im not going to nitpick it In this case theres no need for nitpicking Sit back and enjoy the ride Also to anyone who may be wondering as to if Im familiar with the actual comic books that this is based off of Im not So if this is a faithful adaptation of its source material or not I havent a clue I apologize thats not under my jurisdiction Im a film guy I dont know all that much about the comics My bad I guess I solely base my opinions on the film itself not so much what material it may be based on Although one should never like or dislike a film only because of how faithful of an adaptation it is to a comic book novel etc What is your favorite of the MCU Thats All Folks Do you have any idea the hell I went through to avoid every shred of information being plastered all over the internet for the last five or six days before I was finally able to see Avengers Endgame I deserve a God damn medal for how much effort that took me but what do you think Did you like my review Agree or disagree Wish that Ant-Man could shrink down in size crawl up my ass then enlarge himself to the size of a skyscraper and obliterate me Comment down below and let me know And if you so happened to enjoy my article please do me a favor by sharing this around the social media world Thank you all so much for reading have yourselves a super day  2019 John Plocar",

            "movie_reviews_for_Avengers_Endgame": " I feel as if that is the only word that comes to mind when looking back at the movie This movie did an amazing job at making me go through an emotional rollercoaster but nonetheless I had goosebumps the entire three hours Although I did not enjoy Endgame as much as I enjoyed previous Avenger movies this movie was worth the hype Every moment was unexpected and every gasp was rightfully elicited My initial expectations for the film were that somehow the characters that died in Infinity War would come back alive The movie is picked up right where it left off in Avengers Infinity War which solidified the fact that the ending of Infinity War was very real and the Avengers lost for the first time I went to watch the movie with my sister who has only watched a handful of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films not including Infinity War Surprisingly she didnt seem confused as the movie progressed as the only fact that seemed essential for her to know from Infinity War was that Thanos succeeded in wiping out half the life in the universe We are reacquainted with Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who becomes a key character in the film as his family vanished with the Snap This was also the first time I watched Captain Marvels role played by Brie Larson without seeing the characters own movie that came out about a month ago In my opinion it was not necessary to watch to understand her role which can be said for a lot of the film Ant-Man/Scott Lang played by Paul Rudd made a significant impact on the plot of this film because if it werent for him the Avengers would never begin their mission to fix what has been damaged To further fix the reality they live in the Avengers come together to use non-heroic powers specifically time travelling which Lang experienced to try to salvage what they can There were many times during the movie when the characters Hulk Scott Black Widow Hawkeye Iron Man Captain America Iron Patriot Nebula Rocket and Thor are time travelling where I was thinking so this is just the end what more could the characters have to fight for But I was proven wrong every single time Seeing all the characters unite in such an elegant fashion truly made my jaw drop After time travelling the Avengers are back in present time where they fight Thanos again This began my favorite scene when Captain America saves Thor from being killed by Thanos by using Thors hammer which Thor retrieved when he time travelled a huge moment I never expected as it was thought that Thor was the only one that could use the hammer Im pretty sure I was the only one who cheered and clapped during this moment Each entrance made by each character left a huge impact on the audience Eventually we see the return of the dead characters from Infinity War This entrance of all the revived characters happens at one time which left me a bit overwhelmed From one corner Black Panther and Shuri emerged from another Dr Strange appeared from another Spider-Man appeared and many more Avengers began to assemble to finally defeat Thanos Coming into this movie I of course braced myself as it has been known that many of the actors would not return after this movie It is hard to believe that the heroes I grew up with and make me go awe can somehow end their stories in such a short yet significant moment Nevertheless the Snap from Infinity War brought much heartbreak to the characters in the film but also new life lessons such as valuing family or friendship bonds and that having superpowers can only help you so much The real super power lies in the sacrifice for the benefit of all this movie was really centered on the notion that just because you are a hero does not mean you can fight enemies on your own The two sacrifices of Black Widow and Iron Man proved that they were willing to do anything to keep their planet safe The moment Tony Starks Arc Reactor the metal piece in his chest turns off signaling his death I became emotional We see his sacrifice and how much it affects his wife Pepper Potts and daughter who finds comfort in Happy now Further towards the end we see Thor give the Asgardian kingdom to Valkyrie and Captain America time travels one last time and comes back to the present to hand his shield to Falcon making him the new Captain America We also see Hawkeye reunite with his family members who are revived We dont see what happens to Hulk but we are to assume that the original six Avengers have officially parted ways Because the MCU films in the past had a scene after credits I patiently watched but ended up disappointed in that regard Nonetheless the title soundtrack played for the last time giving me goosebumps especially when each of the six Avengers had their own credit slide where a picture collage was shown for each actor a sort of goodbye from the franchise Walking out of the theater I was strangely satisfied I did not feel like I needed more answers like I felt after Infinity War Rather I felt like the movie accomplished everything that it was supposed to Its hard to believe that this chapter has come to a close these films have surrounded my childhood and coming of age so saying goodbye to these characters was not something I imagined until I watched the movie and realized this is the last time Ill see all these characters on screen For a moment I wished the movie would go on and continue going over three hours so I could just have some more time to soak it all in",

            "movie_reviews_for_Avengers_Endgame": "Review Avengers Endgame brings the Marvel saga to a thrilling time-twisting conclusion for now All good things must come to an end Im not entirely sure what that means for the Marvel Cinematic Universe a remarkable collision of pop-cultural enthusiasms and commercial imperatives that has been a force for occasional good and overwhelming mediocrity But you take the good where you can get it these days and so it is with no small pleasure or exhaustion that I report that the Marvel series or at least this current phase of it has come to a stirring satisfying finish with Avengers Endgame At first you may not be sure whether that satisfaction springs from the specific quality of the movie or from the simple relief that closure even imperfect temporary closure can provide After 11 years 22 films and more than 18 billion in global box office a number that will start to look pretty puny by oh yesterday who has the energy to complain The overarching message of this blockbuster franchise and of its megalomaniacal overlords at the Walt Disney Co has always been that resistance like criticism is futile I say this as someone who found much to resist in last years Avengers Infinity War and who was struck less by the audacity than the cynicism of its doomsday cliffhanger in which a giant talking eggplant named Thanos Josh Brolin wiped out half the worlds population with the snap of a finger Perhaps I undersold Infinity War insofar as it clearly planted the seeds of my own inevitable surrender Cinematic mythmaking this indulgent in size and scale has a way of forging its own rules as well as its own loopholes And loopholes another word for them might be contradictions are crucial to the pleasures of Avengers Endgame Despite its epic ambitions and tumescent running time Endgame often feels shorter looser and lighter on its feet than some of its Marvel brethren Directed with considerable verve like its predecessor by the brothers Joe and Anthony Russo working again from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely this three-hour leviathan is the longest picture in the Marvel cycle and certainly the most consequential Thats a bit of a paradox insofar as the hectic sprawling pleasingly nonsensical plot is largely about the undoing of consequences To push the contradictions still further Despite its epic ambitions and tumescent running time Endgame often feels shorter looser and lighter on its feet than some of its Marvel brethren Thats true at least until a cataclysmic showdown an ensemble mash-up of inevitably staggering proportions that like too many of the action sequences in these movies devolves into a murky indecipherable blur I probably should have prefaced that with a spoiler warning sorry If I had the six Infinity Stones in my possession I would gladly turn back time to the moment before I wrote that last sentence Or I might just suspend your ability to read printed material until after youve made it to the theater Alas the Stones are gone and altering reality isnt so simple Iron Man Robert Downey Jr tempering his deadpan wit with industrial-strength gravitas will learn this firsthand after he and Nebula the ever-compelling Karen Gillan make their way back through space to a newly decimated Earth It will fall to them and the other surviving Avengers to manipulate time and defeat Thanos who pleased with his handiwork has retreated to a distant planet to spend his days in peace RELATED The missing Avengers return Paul Rudd and Jeremy Renner are back for Endgame Peace is a seductive notion and for a while the movie toys with the idea that everyone should just leave bad enough alone The movies post-apocalyptic hangout vibe is both depressing and liberating Some of the best moments transpire in the first half when the action speeds up without warning one big payoff arrives far earlier than you expect and then suddenly anxiously decelerates Grim reality sets in and the trauma and tragedy of losing several billion human souls in an instant begins to take its toll This melancholy interlude doesnt last long Our heroes have distant galaxies to visit magic baubles to hunt down and a lot of strenuously irreverent banter to get through The revolution will be co-led by powerful new allies like Carol Danvers Brie Larson her radioactive glow undimmed from her recent introduction in Captain Marvel while MCU bench-warmers like Ant-Man Paul Rudd previously trapped in the quantum realm will contribute an ingenious physics lesson or two to the discussion The lethal and often lethally boring archer Hawkeye Jeremy Renner gets more of an emotional workout than usual while Bruce Banner Mark Ruffalo long bedeviled by his Jekyll-and-Hulk identity crisis returns with a hard-won measure of personal equilibrium Who else Iron Man and Captain America Chris Evans having more or less made up after their mighty frat-house brawl from a few years ago both seek out zones of personal contentment amid the chaos The steadfast Black Widow Scarlett Johansson keeps the faith as do Okoye an underused Danai Gurira War Machine Don Cheadle and that wisecracking raccoon Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper Thor Chris Hemsworth Im sorry to say has seen better days Ill leave it at that so as not to ruin several moments of honest unforced delight Suffice to say that as it turns out killing off half of Infinity Wars ridiculously overstuffed ensemble wasnt the worst way to boost emotional investment across the board RELATED Avengers Endgame marks Stan Lees final cameo It was like Santa came to set Before long the surviving characters are ricocheting through the recent past cheekily referencing movies like Back to the Future and Somewhere in Time and reviving the classic would-you-kill-Hitler debate for the Thanos era Theres something irresistible about watching a bunch of battered but resilient souls join forces and brainstorm their way out of a pickle and it may briefly remind you of the days when these movies felt like a relatively scrappy spirited collective undertaking Along the way the laws of cinematic time travel are flouted even more recklessly than usual as the movie hopscotches its way through a series of flashbacks from earlier missions sacrificing a measure of narrative rigor and coherence to tickle your nostalgia A few old scores are settled and some familiar faces briefly return some of them no less welcome for having been digitally altered The inside jokes and fan-service digressions are blatant and relentless but also pretty effective The conflicting narrative priorities that often bedevil an epic series finale how to tell a story that builds with inexorable momentum while also staging the mother of all cast reunions are cleverly and resourcefully reconciled You might wish the filmmakers had given us more moments with characters like Okoye Valkyrie Tessa Thompson and the perpetually sidelined Pepper Potts Gwyneth Paltrow whose brief cameos here serve to remind you that despite some necessary diversification the Marvel cosmos is still dominated by the spectacle of various men yelling scowling and smashing the computer-generated scenery You might also wish that the final battle were more spatially and tactically coherent that it didnt feel like such an autopilot-directed rush job RELATED Tessa Thompson on Valkyries Avengers Endgame whereabouts and Captain Marvel shippers To be clear I have no wish to see a longer version of this movie But time is a relative concept especially in the movies and the Russos largely succeed by treating it with a wondrous sense of elasticity Thats apparent not only in their delirious play with narrative chronology but also in our slow-dawning awareness that our time with at least some of these characters will be fleeting and finite The mass slaughter at the end of Infinity War felt both colossal and weightless insofar as you knew it was little more than an epic tease But the deaths that transpire here are all the more poignant for feeling both carefully considered and genuinely irreversible To these faintly moistened eyes Avengers Endgame achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling even as it falls just short of real catharsis Even the most memorable of these characters have always felt more like sentient constructs flesh-and-blood cogs in an endlessly whirring narrative machinery But here Iron Man and Captain America and the rest serve an undeniable purpose which is to remind you however belatedly that great superheroes are nothing without real human vulnerability and a willingness to face the ultimate sacrifice The lessons of Avengers Endgame are thus as old as time itself and no less welcome for being reiterated There is no life without death no triumph without defeat no forward progress without a glance in the rear-view mirror Which is where this story at long last resides and where in a saner universe it might have the grace to remain ------------ Avengers Endgame Rating PG-13 for sequences of sci-fi violence and action and some language Running time 3 hours 2 minutes Playing Opens April 26 in general release Marvel
