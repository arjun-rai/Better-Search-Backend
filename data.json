    "In the realm of fitness, three-month workout programs dominate the landscape. Youve even seen plenty of them in our magazine over the years. Are they effective? Absolutely. But were going to let you in on an interesting secret. It doesn’t necessarily take 8 or 12 weeks to get your feet wet in the gym. Not that you’ll be a seasoned vet after four weeks, but if you can just get that first month under your belt, you’ll get yourself over the proverbial hump where so many fail and give up, and set the stage for a lifetime of muscle gains. Let’s just call this the accelerated beginner’s guide to bodybuilding.\n\nIn this plan, your first month of training will be demanding, but not so demanding as to cause injury or worse yet, burnout and progressive in the sense that each week you’ll graduate to different exercises, higher volume, more intensity, or all of the above. After four weeks, you’ll not only be ready for the next challenge, but you'll have built a significant amount of quality muscle. In other words, one month from now, you’ll look significantly better with your shirt off than you look now. How’s that for results?\n\nThis program isn’t just for the true beginner who has never touched a weight before, it’s also suitable for anyone who has taken an extended leave of absence from training. How long has it been since you went to the gym regularly? Six months? A year? Five years? No worries. The following routines will get you back on track in—you guessed it—just four short weeks. Let's get to work.\n\nWeek 1: Full-Body Training Split\n- Train three days this first week, performing just one exercise per body part in each session. It’s important that you have a day of rest between each workout to allow your body to recover, this makes training Monday, Wednesday and Friday—with Saturday and Sunday being rest days—a good approach.\n- Exercises: A collection of basic moves that are suitable for the beginner as well as used by advanced lifters. Not only machine exercises but also a handful of free-weight movements to master for long-term gains in muscular size and strength.\n- Sets & Reps: Perform three sets of every exercise per workout, 3x per week for each body part. With the exception of crunches for abs, do 8-12 reps per set. Your first set calls for eight reps, your second set 10 reps, and your third set 12 reps. This is called a reverse pyramid where you decrease the weight each set to complete the higher rep count.\n\nWeek 2: Two-Day Training Split\n- Train four days this week: the split includes two upper-body days (Monday and Thursday) and two lower-body days (Tuesday and Friday), and each body part is trained twice. Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday will be your recovery days.\n- New Exercise: One move is added to each body part routine (with the exception of abs), so you can train all muscle groups more completely from multiple angles. Dumbbell bench press for the chest and dumbbell flye to target the pecs greater.\n- Sets & Reps: Reverse pyramid scheme of reps, going slightly higher in reps to 15 on your third set of each exercise. This helps increase muscular endurance for a solid foundation on which to build size and strength.\n\nWeek 3: Three-Day Training Split\n- Step it up to a three-day training split; train all pushing body parts (chest, shoulders, triceps) on Day 1, hitting the pulling body parts (back, biceps, abs) on Day 2, and working your lower body (quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves) on Day 3.\n- Total Training: Train six days this week, with each body part being hit twice.\n- New Exercise: One new exercise is added to each body part routine for more angles. Hit each muscle group with two exercises of 3-4 sets each, four sets for large body parts (chest, back, shoulders, quads, hamstrings) and three sets for smaller body parts (biceps, triceps, abs, calves). Work in the 8-15 rep range.\n\nWeek 4: Four-Day Training Split\n- Train four days in a four-way split that hits each body part just once (except for calves and abs which are each trained twice).\n- Split: Chest and triceps paired; back and biceps paired; quads and hamstrings paired; shoulders more or less own; alternate hitting calves and abs every other workout.\n- Sets & Reps: No new exercises introduced. Rep schemes remain in the hypertrophy range but overall volume increases by adding more sets to individual exercises, up to five sets per move for larger body parts and even 10 sets of calf raises on Thursday. This ensures muscles are overloaded sufficiently to continue growth experienced in the first three weeks.\n\nCompletion of this four-week program now entitles you to go to the next stage.",
